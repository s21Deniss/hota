#### Folding wings

**Clones will spawn at 3/7/1 o'clock vykas will then proceed to jump on one of them in order, people outside the range will die. This can be solved with dead people in party**

5 people in cross positions pickup 1 buff per person, then run back to the middle

Note: you can only take 1 debuff, you will die if you take 2

3 people with clock positions run to determined positions and check wings on the clones, type in chat what you have seen ex: _3 open_ or _3 closed_ afterwards run back to the middle

> If purple is in majority start with folded wings and go 0-1-2 open wings

> If red is in majority start with open wings and 2-1-0 open wings

Now you should run to the clones in order above

## 65 hp

#### Red/Black orbs memory game

**Clones will spawn at positions, sending black orbs to Vykas players have to block said black orbs **
Go to your position, 7-3 and 11-3 be ready to move around

Players at position x-1 count when black aura appears and type that in chat position + what orb will be black `ex: 5 234` means at 5 o'clock black orbs will be number 2,3,4 so you will need 3 people at 5 o'clock

Supporting positions will move to position where 3 black orbs will spawn

Afterwards all orb will be masked as black only take the black orbs

Notes: you can only take 1 orb or you will die, you can take 2 orbs using timestop or splendid panacea
