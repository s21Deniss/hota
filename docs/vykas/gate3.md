#### Notes

## 170 HP **Swamp**

2 people with slow buff put them in sequence at 9 o'clock

rest stay near and just to the furthest slow ground

> Good dps slot for ranged classes

## 150 HP **Sword and clones**

You need at least 1 person with >70% of lust meter, ping all the locations of the swords

Go to position where sword and clone overlaps

## 135 HP **Boomer test**

Everyone should run to pre determined cleansing orb and clear their lust meter

Win simple input mini game

> Good place to use Nineveh after minigame

## 120 HP **Throne**

Stack up in the middle and fill up <span style="color:red"> lust bar </span>

## 105 HP **Stagger Check**

Use second cleansing orb to cleat lust bar

Run to the middle and stagger the boss (don't use wei)

Use timestop potion when large frog will start glowing red, most of t he time its right after passing stagger check

## 75  HP **Swamp**

Repeat mechanic **Swamp** from [170 HP bar](#_170-HP-swamp)

## 55  HP **Tentacles**

It's good to save awakening for this phase

Tank red orbs flying from the middle until you have >70% of the lust meter indicated by split on its bar, do not overdue it and get mind controlled

Destroy tentacles, you will need >70% of lust meter to damage them.

Start by killing at your spot then run to help others

## 40  HP **Release orbs**

4 orbs will spawn at 2/4/8/11 o'clock 4 players with lowest lust bar must take the orbs and spam 'space' afterwards to get free

## 0   HP **Final stagger**

Locate vykas on the minimap and face her ( away from the clone in the middle)

After medusa mech is over run behind vykas

> Good time to use Wei
